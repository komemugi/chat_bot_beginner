I made this application for the open campus.
Due to limited RAM and storage, it handled llm.

## Overall process flow:
 1. load a model named ‘tokyotech-llm/Swallow-13b-instruct-v0.1’.
 2. quantise the model.
 3. prepare dataset.
 4. tokenising the dataset.
 5. training with lora.
 6. generate text.
